	Armored Cannon Beetle
		Shell opening now knocks pikmin forward

==== Iteration 4 ====
	This iteration focuses on incorporating some of Pikmin 4's changes, and other tweaks
	
	Large Rolling Boulder
		New object
		Acts like rolling boulder, but with different stats
			Radius Bigger (32 -> 64)
			Moves Slower (200 -> 150)
			Turns slower (50 -> 5)
	
	Armored Cannon Beetle
		Now spits Large Rolling Boulders
		Now turns a bit towards the target when spitting
	
	Spicy Spray
		Reduced duration (40 -> 20)
		Reduced speed multiplier (1.5 -> 1.2)
		Increased anim_speed_multiplier (1 -> 1.3)
		Increased maturity change (0 -> 2)
		Note: This was done to make spicy sprays have some combat usage, but not too much that it trivializes everything
	
	Spicy Burgeoning Spiderwort
		Increased recharge amount (1 -> 5)
		Note: This meant getting a single spray took 10 in game minutes, now it takes 2
		
	Bitter Burgeoning Spiderwort
		Increased recharge amount (1 -> 5)
		Increased recharge time (60 -> 120)
		Note: Bitter sprays are *MUCH* more powerful, so they should be slower to obtain
		
	Burned, Bubbled, Drowining, Shocked, Poisoned
		Decreased maturity change (0 -> -1)
		
	Pikmin
		Increased maturity_speed_mult (0.1 -> 0.15)

		Increased Landing damage (5 -> 25)
		Increased base speed (90 -> 100)
		Stun changes
			Reduced slow (40% -> 20%)
			Stacking now resets time instead of adding
		Note: This was done to bring purple pikmin more in line with Pikmin 4, while keeping their unique stun still there
	
	Leaders
		Increased movement speed (130 -> 150)
		Decreased Plucking animation length (0.6 -> 0.4)
	
	Zoom
		Max zoom decreased (3.0 -> 2.5)
		Min zoom increased (0.66 -> 1)

==== Release Candidate 3 ====
	This iteration ports the pack to 0.23.2 and focuses on fixing inconsistencies
	In addition, minor suggestions are implemented
	
	Cloaking burrow-nit
		Standardized wither chance (5%)
	Dwarf Red Bulborb
		Only screeches the first time it shakes
	Fire Geyser
		Removed damange knockback
		Note: Some sprites had it, some didn't. To further distinguish fire from electricity, it was removed from all sprites
	
	Drowning
		Health change increased (-0.5 -> -0.4)
		Note: Since escaping drowning is often more difficult than fire or poison, it should take longer to kill pikmin.
		Speed Multiplier increased (0.2 -> 0.3)
		Note: This was an unrecorded change from a previous iteration.
		
	Burned
		Health change now properly set (-0.6 -> -0.5)
		Note: This change was not properly recorded in previous iterations. It has been put in line to match Bubbled and Poisioned
	
	Electrocuted, Crushed
		Health change reverted (-2.0 -> -1.5)
		Note: As mentioned by Espyo, this allows the player to process how pikmin die, and has no effect in combat
	White Pikmin Poison
		health_change reverted (-800 -> -200)
		auto_remove_time reverted (1 -> 4)

==== Release Candidate 2 ====
	This iteration tweaks previous changes and makes introduces purple pikmin stunning
	
	Purple Pikmin
		Landing damage decreased (8 -> 5)
		Attacking damage decreased (15 -> 10)
		Added on land stun
			Applies a 40% slow for 0.2 seconds
			Time stacks as more pikmin land
		
	Red Bulborb	& Whiptongue Bulborb
		Reordered hitbox priority (head/body/lower_body -> body/lower_body/head)
		
	Bubbled, Burned, Poisoned, Drowning
		Health change decreased (-0.4 -> -0.5)
		Note: Iteration 3's release did not have status changes, so the actual change is (-0.3 -> -0.5)
	White Pikmin Poison
		health_change decreased (-200 -> -800)
		auto_remove_time decreased (4 -> 1)


==== Iteration 3 / Release Candidate 1 ====
	This iteration dives deeper into tweaking enemies, focusing on script and animation changes
	In addition, previous changes are further tweaked.
	
	Armored Cannon Beetle
		Reduced hot struggle time (5 seconds -> 3)
		Reduced cool struggle time (5 seconds -> 4)
		Note: Decreasing the struggle time while keeping it possible for reds to one phase it make reds more useful while also keeping all pikmin viable
	Beady Long Legs
		Increased rest time (1 second -> 2 - 4)
		Note: Currently, the BLL has an incredibly small damage window for non yellow pikmin making it near impossible to cause damage with non yellows. This makes other pikmin much more viable without outclassing yellow pikmin.
	Dwarf Red Bulborb
		Health increased (100 -> 150)
		Added screeching
			Occurs before a shake
			Any sleeping Red Bulborb in a 300 unit radius will wake up when a screech occurs
	Red Bulborb
		Split back hitbox into two separate hitboxes: body and body_lower
			body_lower is the bottom 32 units of the original back hitbox and has a defense multiplier of 1.5
			body now consists of the higher 96 units of the orignal back hitbox
			body_lower has lower knockback (2)
		Renamed old "body" hitbox to "head" to be consistent with Whiptongue Bulborb
	Whiptongue Bulborb
		Same hitbox split as Red Bulborb
	Note: Bulborb changes were added to introduce a more interesting decision between swarming and throwing, having to choose between more attacks/sec or more damage/attack respectively.	
	
	Wood Bridge
		Health increased (2000 -> 10000)
		Note: This was overlooked during Iteration 2 buffing gates, so it has been added here.
		
==== Iteration 2 ====
	This iteration introduces changes to pikmin's damage and enemies' health.
	In addition, previous changes are further tweaked.
	
	Leaders
		Explosion vulnerability reduced (100% -> 37.5%)
		Note: This gives a bomb rock the equivilant damage of a strong hit
	
	Rock Pikmin
		Damage increased (20 -> 40)
		Note: Rock pikmin in Pikmin 3 get an inconsistent damage boost when they are thrown. Without this buff rock pikmin severly lack behind due to their low attacks per second.
	Red Pikmin
		Damage increased (12 -> 15)
	Purple Pikmin
		Damage increased (11 -> 15)
	White Pikmin
		Damage reduced (9 -> 8)
	Bulbmin
		Damage reduced (12 -> 10)
	
	Armored Cannon Beetle
		Health increased (1300 -> 1800)
	Dwarf Red Bulborb
		Health reduced (200 -> 100)
	Red Bulborb
		Health increased (750 -> 1000)
	Yellow Wollywog
		Health reduced (1600 -> 900)
	Whiptongue Bulborb
		Health increased (975 -> 1300)
	
	Crystal Nodule
		Damage reduced (300 -> 200)
	
	Bomb rocks
		Damage increased (500 -> 800)
	
	Electric Gate
		Health increased (2000 -> 8000)
	White Bramble Gate
		Health increased (2000 -> 16000)
		Explosion vulnerability increased (100% -> 1000%)
	Note: While the rest of these health values generally fit P3, I was only able to find data for P2's electric gate, so it's used as a reference.
	Reinforced Wall
		Health increased (1500 -> 2400)

==== Iteration 1 ====
	This iteration focuses on standardizing enemy damage to leaders. Damage values are based on Pikmin 1, doing either 10%, 20%, or 30% of a leader's health. The only exception to this are bomb rocks, which do 50% of a leader's health.
	Furthermore, shakes have been standardized to do a small amount of damage.
	Pikmin's health has also been tweaked, as the higher values would otherwise instakill pikmin. 
	With changing the health regen to health ratio in order to prevent death from multiple strong attacks, statuses needed to be made slightly stronger to compensate. 
	
	Leaders
		Standardized acceleration (800)
		HP reduced (2000 -> 1000)
		
	Pikmin
		Health increased (100 -> 500)
		Health regen increased (10 -> 100)
		Note: This makes sure that pikmin aren't instantly killed by higher power attacks, and otherwise doesn't affect gameplay
		The increased health regen makes sure that they won't die to multiple repeated attacks
		
	Bubbled, Burned, Poisoned, Drowning
		Health change decreased (-0.3 -> -0.4)
	Electrocuted, Crushed
		Health change decreased (-1.5 -> -2.0)
		
	Bombrock
		Damage reduced (600 -> 500)
		Health increased (50 -> 500)

			Weak (100)
				Dwarf Red Bulborb
				Adult Bulbmin
				Crumbug
				Cloaking Burrow-Nit
				Electric Water Dumple (Stun)
				Water Dumple
			Medium (200)
				Firey Blowhog
				Red Bulborb
				Electric Water Dumple (Bite)
				Yellow Wollywog
				Whiptongue Bulborb
				Fire Geyser
				Electric Wire
			Strong (300)
				Rolling Boulder
				Beady Long Legs Foot
				Crystal Nodule
				
		Shake/Knockback damage standardized across enemies (20)
			
	Armored Cannon Beetle
		Hot flesh hitbox is no longer enabled when cooling or closing
	Rolling Boulder
		Speed increased (125 -> 200)	
	Reinforced Wall
		Health reduced (1800 -> 1500)
